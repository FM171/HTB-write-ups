# CandyVault Web Challange HTB 

## Executive Summary 

Our testing indicates that the overall security of CandyVault.com requires significant improvement. We identified a critical NoSQL Injection vulnerability in the login functionality, which allowed us to bypass authentication. The main attack vector utilized a NoSQL Injection payload sent via a proxy tool (Burp Suite). This vulnerability exists because the login logic does not properly validate user input, allowing queries to match any document where the email and password fields are not null rather than being valid. 


#  MongoDB Injection authenticaion bypass 


## Description

The login functionality of CandyVault.com is vulnerable to NoSQL Injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input. The application directly incorporates unvalidated email and password values from client requests into MongoDB queries:

```user = users_collection.find_one({"email": email, "password": password})```


Because input is not type-checked or sanitized, an attacker can inject MongoDB operators (e.g., $ne) instead of scalar string values. This allows bypassing of authentication checks by submitting a crafted JSON payload.


## Impact 

An authentication bypass allows attackers to log in without valid credentials. This directly violates the security principle of confidentiality, as unauthorized users can view sensitive or confidential information. This makes it a high-severity security issue requiring immediate remediation.

## Likelihood:
Low probability, high severity â€” requires file access to identify, but easily exploitable once discovered.

## Evidence 

Snippet from routes.py
```
@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])
def login():
    content_type = request.headers.get("Content-Type")

    if content_type == "application/x-www-form-urlencoded":
        email = request.form.get("email")
        password = request.form.get("password")

    elif content_type == "application/json":
        data = request.get_json()
        email = data.get("email")
        password = data.get("password")
    
    else:
        return jsonify({"error": "Unsupported Content-Type"}), 400

    user = users_collection.find_one({"email": email, "password": password})

    if user:
        return render_template("candy.html", flag=open("flag.txt").read())
    else:
        return redirect("/")

```

As we can see from the above the ```user = users_collection.find_one({"email": email, "password": password})``` this just needs the fields to exist in database.


Replication steps 

1. Intercept the /login POST request using Burp suite 

2. On post payload change Content-Type to application/json.

> We know from files the website uses MongoDB so simple research and find statement that search for email and password that is not null 


4. Replace the body with payload:

    ``` {"email": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null}  } ```


5. Forward the request

6. Successful login
